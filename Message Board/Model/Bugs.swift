/*
 Problem: No Data being sent to server
    - Check to see if data is being encoded/decoded
    - Found a missing resume in the create function
 
 Problem: Table View still not loading
    - Check table view to make sure cells are being populated correctly
    - Also needed to resume function and fix reload of data on main queue
 
 Problem: Cancel and Send Buttons not working
    - Check both methods to see how they are specifically designed and if they need to be refactored
